			<p>I am a 26 year old web developer with a background in economics, data science, and Commercial Real Estate. I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2015 with a double major in History and Economics. My courses covered American Economic History and the History of Economic Thought, alongside Game Theory, Consumer Choice Theory, and Econometrics. I have worked for the past two years as a Research Analyst at NAI Capital to help expand their database structure and provide valuable insight to a general audience. My work involves gathering data from several of our database vendors and compiling them into market reports that cover all four markets in the Greater Los Angeles Area across all four product types: Office, Industrial, Retail, and Multifamily. AFter working in the Commercial Real Estate industry for two years, I have decided to broaden my horizons by stepping into software and web development, alongside data science.</p>
			<p>My future goals for this program are to advance my skills in various programming languages to a point where I can successfully utilize them to develop applications that can be useful either on their own, or as part of a product utilized by a company or corporation for data science. Additionally, I am planning on developing a skillset to use Python to create applications, alongside web development projects that incorporate unity and various video game concepts.</p>
